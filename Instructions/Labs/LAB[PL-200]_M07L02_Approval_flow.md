Module 7: Build Power Automate cloud flows
========================

## Lab 7.2: Practice Lab – Build an approval flow

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Scenario
--------

Your client Fabrikam needs an approval process added to their model-driven
Knowledge Admin app. The approval process will notify the user's manager to
obtain an approval or rejection and handle the knowledge assessment
appropriately.

In this lab, you will create a **Microsoft Power Automate** cloud flow to
retrieve the appropriate manager, seek their approval, and edit the row based on
the manager's decision.
