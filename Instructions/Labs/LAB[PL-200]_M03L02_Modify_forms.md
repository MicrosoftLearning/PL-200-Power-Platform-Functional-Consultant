Module 3: Make model-driven apps with Power Apps
============================================

## Lab 3.2: Practice Lab – Modify forms

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)


Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. In this practice you will be
continuing your work on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice,
you will be modifying the auto generated forms to add the new columns you added
in the data-modeling practice.

## Exercise 1 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment Form

In this exercise, you will edit the form for the Knowledge Assessment table.

### Task 1 – Enable Notes on the Knowledge Assessment table

Initially when the table was created notes were not enabled. Since then, the
client Fabrikam has determined that they would like to be able to track notes against
the knowledge assessments. We are going to make this change before getting into
the form editor, because this is the easiest way to perform these configuration
steps. The same is true, for example, if you need to add any columns: you should
always try to add the columns before jumping into the editor.

1.  Navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com>.

2.  Make sure you are in the **Practice** environment you created.

3.  Select **Solutions**.

4.  Open the **Common Data Service Default Solution**.

5.  Open the **Knowledge Assessment** table.

6.  Click **Settings** in the command bar (you may need to click the **...** to see this option)

7.  Check the **Enable Attachments** checkbox. This enables notes and files for
    the table.

8.  Click **Save**.

9.  Click **Common Data Service Default Solution** and select **Publish all customizations**.

### Task 2 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment form

In this task, you will perform the following changes to the form:

-   Put columns in the header

-   Insert the Timeline control

-   Add a tab that contains a list of related assessment questions

To customize your form:

1.  Navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com>.

2.  Make sure you are in the **Practice** environment you created.

3.  Select **Solutions**.

4.  Open the **Common Data Service Default Solution**.

5.  Select the **Knowledge Admin** model-driven app.

6.  Click **Edit**.

7.  Locate the **Knowledge Assessment** table and select **Forms**.

8.  Go to the **Components** tab, hover over the **Information** form in the
    **Main Forms** section, and click **edit** (the pencil icon).

9.  Click on the **Header** section of the form. (This is the top section of the
    form that says **New Knowledge Assessment.**) 
    
    **Note:** If the screen size is too small to view the content, on the bottom of the page, Screen resizing option is available. 

10. Select the **Table columns** from the left control tab and uncheck the **Show only unused
    columns** checkbox.

11. Drag the **Owner** column from the list and place it in the **header** on the
    right side of the form. You should now have two **Owner** columns on the
    form: one in the **General** section, and one in the **header.**

12. Select the **General** tab by clicking on it. Enter **General** in the
    **Name** field in the Properties pane.

    Change the **Label** to **Timeline** and change the **Name** to
    **Timeline.**

19. Select the **Owner** column from the **General** section.

20. Click the **trash** button from the top menu. We are removing this column
    because we added a duplicate column to the header.

21. Add the **Start Date** column to the **General** section and place it below
    the **Title** column. You can add columns to the form by dragging the column
    from the Table columns and dropping it in the section you want to add the
    column to.

22. Add the **End Date** to the **General** section and place it below the
    **Start Date** column.
