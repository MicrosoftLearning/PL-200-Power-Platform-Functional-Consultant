Module 4: Build Power Apps
======================================

Lab 4.8: Practice Lab – User experience

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. You have been assigned to
continue work on the Fabrikam Knowledge canvas app that we started creating in
the prior module. In this practice you will be providing the user with visual
feedback of which questions they got right and wrong. You will also be enabling
the score button only if the user has provided some answers.

Exercise 1 – Customizing the User Experience
--------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Show the Assessment Result 

In this task, you will show the assessment result to the user. In this task you
will use a local variable ShowResults to indicate if the results should show. It
will be updated upon the user clicking the score button. Each item will then use
an expression to highlight if the answer is right or wrong, only when
ShowResults is true.

1.  Select **Answer4Selected** checkbox of the **assessmentQuestionList**.

2.  Select the **Fill** property of **Answer4Selected** and set it to the
    snippet below. This snippet will:

    - Set the Fill Color to White if ShowResults is false.

    - Set the Fill Color to Red id ShowResults is true, the checkbox is check, and
    the Points value is less than 0.

    - Set the Fill Color to Green id ShowResults is true, the checkbox is check,
    and the Points value is more than 0.

            If(ShowResults, If(answer4Selected.Value = true && ThisItem.'Answer 4 Points' > 0, Green, If(answer4Selected.Value = false, White, Red)), White)

1.  Select the **Fill** property of **Answer3Selected** checkbox and set to the
    snippet below.

1.  Select the **Fill** property of **Answer2Selected** checkbox and set to the
    snippet below.

1.  Select the **Fill** property of **Answer1Selected** checkbox and set to the
    snippet below.

        If(ShowResults, If(answer1Selected.Value = true && ThisItem.'Answer 1 Points' >  0, Green, If(answer1Selected.Value = false, White, Red)), White)

### Task 2 – Disable/Enable Button 

In this task, you will disable the score button if there are no answers selected
and enable it when there is at least one answer selected.

1.  Select the **scoreButton**.

2.  With the **scoreButton** selected, set the **DisplayMode** property to the
    snippet below. This snippet will disable the button if there are no answers
    selected and enable it if there is at least one answer selected.

        If(CountRows(UserAnswers) > 0, DisplayMode.Edit, DisplayMode.Disabled)

### Task 6 – Other things you can try

Now that you have built a basic canvas app that interacts with the Common Data
Service, here are some things you can try on your own to make the app better.
**The following steps are optional and are more advanced to challenge your
learning. These are not expected or required to all be completed.**

1.  Try different ways of presenting the Test Results – for example you could
    try the Data Grid control.

2.  Add an image control to the mainScreen and show the user’s profile image
    using User().Image. Note: You will need to setup a profile image for the
    user you are using for it to show more than the default image.

3.  You can add an image to the Knowledge Assessment entity and then change the
    mainScreen list of Assessments to show the image. Note: after you add the
    entity image in CDS, you will need to upload an image via the model-driven
    app. You will also need to go to View-Data Sources and refresh the Knowledge
    Assessment entity metadata.

4.  Think about how else you might improve the app using the knowledge you’ve
    gained during the practices. You can always Save As your app, and try any
    changes you want without impacting your completed work!
