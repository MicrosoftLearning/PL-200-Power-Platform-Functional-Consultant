Module 5: Build Power Automate flows
==================

## Lab 5.1: Practice Lab – Create users

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. You will be continuing your work
on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice, you will be creating
a dashboard and modifying the app to include it.

We need to add additional users to be able to use the application we have built.
You will be adding three users to the tenant; one manager and two additional
users.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Office 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this
course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or
reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time
you close the lab session. Please be aware that Office 365 is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual Office 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.
