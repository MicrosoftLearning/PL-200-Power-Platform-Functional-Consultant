Module 5: Build a Power Automate flow
================================

## Lab 5.7: Practice Lab – Build a business process flow

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Scenario
--------

You have been building automations to support your client Fabrikam’s knowledge
assessment process. The client is concerned that their users won’t be able to
create new knowledge assessments without your help. You need to create a guided

assessments. In this lab, you will enable the knowledge assessment entity for
business process flows and then build a business process flow.
