Module 1: Introduction to Microsoft Power Platform 
=================================

## Practice Lab – Validate lab environment

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)


## Scenario

In this Module 1 lab, you will acquire a Power Platform trial tenant and access
the Microsoft Power Platform admin center. In the admin center, we will create an
individual environment for configuration during the course.

## Exercise 1 – Acquire your Microsoft Power Platform trial tenant

1.  Copy your **Microsoft 365 credentials** from the Authorized Lab Hoster.

2.  Navigate to <https://powerapps.microsoft.com/>. Click **Start free.**

3.  Click **Start free.**

4.  Under **Get started**, enter the email address from your Microsoft 365
    credentials in the text box that says **Enter your work email address.**
    Click **Sign up.**

5.  You will see a prompt that you have an existing account with Microsoft.
    Select **Sign in.**

6.  Enter the password provided by the Authorized Lab Hoster. Click **Sign in.**

7.  At the **Almost there** prompt, click **Start.**

    **Note:** Depending on your internet browser, you may be prompted to sign in
    again. Select **Sign in**, click the email account you just signed in with,
    and continue. You may also be prompted to provide more information. Enter
    1234567890 in the Phone number field, and click **Get started**.

8.  Select **Yes** to stay signed in. On the page that shows **You're all set**,
    click **Get started**.
    
    **Note:** If you get a **Sorry, there's been a disconnect** error message then try to refresh the page. 

## Exercise 2 - Create your environment

In this exercise, you will create your **Practice** environment that you will
do the majority of your lab work in.

### Task 1 – Create environment

1.  Navigate to <https://admin.powerplatform.com> and log in with your Microsoft 365 credentials if prompted again.

2.  If you are not automatically directed there, select **Environments** from the left navigation pane and
    click **+New.**

    -   For **Name**, enter **[my initials] Practice.** (Example: AJ Practice.)

    -   For **Type**, select **Trial.** You may see an option for **Trial
        (subscription-based)** - select the option that only says **Trial.**

    -   Change the **Create a database for this environment?** toggle to
        **Yes.**

    -   Leave all other selections as default and click **Next.**

    -   On the next tab, change the toggle for **Deploy sample apps and data?**
        to **Yes.** Click **Save**.

3.  Your **Practice** environment should now show in the list of Environments.

4.  Your environment may take a few minutes to provision. Refresh the page if
    needed. When your environment is prepared, select your **Practice**
    environment by clicking on the ellipses next to its name to expand the drop
    down menu and select **Settings.**

5.  Explore the different areas in **Settings** that you are interested in but
    do not make any changes yet.

**NOTE** Depending on the browser that you are using, it is suggested that you
disable any pop-up blockers that maybe enabled. This will prevent popup screens
from not appearing as they should.
