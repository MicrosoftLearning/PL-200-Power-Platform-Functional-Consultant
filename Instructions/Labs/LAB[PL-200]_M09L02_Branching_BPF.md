Module 9: Build business process flows
================================

## Lab 9.2: Practice Lab – Build a branching business process flow

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Scenario
--------

You have created several automation to support your client’s knowledge
assessments process and now it is time to bring the final pieces together. In
this lab, you will update the business process flow and add a business rule.

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Office 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. You will only be provided with one tenant for the practice labs in this
course. The settings and actions you take within this tenant do not roll-back or
reset, whereas the virtual machine you are provided with does reset each time
you close the lab session. Please be aware that Office 365 is evolving all the
time. The instructions in this document may be different from what you
experience in your actual Office 365 tenant. It is also possible to experience a
delay of several minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to
begin the labs.
