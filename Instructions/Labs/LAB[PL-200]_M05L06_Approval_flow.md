Module 5: Build Power Automate flows
========================

## Lab 5.6: Practice Lab – Build approval flow

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Knowledge Admin app. The approval process will notify
the user's manager to obtain an approval or rejection and handle the knowledge assessment appropriately.

retrieve the appropriate manager, seek their approval, and edit the record based on the manager's decision.
