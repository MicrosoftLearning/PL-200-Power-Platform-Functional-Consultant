Module 4: Build Power Apps
============================================

## Lab 4.2: Practice Lab – Modifying forms

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)


Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. In this practice you will be
continuing your work on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice,
you will be modifying the auto generated forms to add the new fields you added
in the data-modeling practice.

Exercise 1 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment Form 
------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will edit the form for the Knowledge Assessment entity.

### Task 1 – Enable Notes on the Knowledge Assessment entity

Initially when the entity was created notes were not enabled. Since then the
client Fabrikam has determined that they like to be able to track notes against
the knowledge assessments. We are going to make this change before getting into
the form editor, because this is the easiest way to perform these configuration steps. The same is true, for
example, if you need to add any fields: you should always try to add the fields
before jumping into the editor.

1.  Navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com>.

2.  Make sure you are in the **Practice** environment you created.

3.  Select **Solutions**.

4.  Open the **Common Data Service Default Solution**.

5.  Click on the **Knowledge Assessment** table.

6.  Click **Settings** in the command bar.

7.  Check the **Enable Attachments** checkbox. This enables notes and files for
    the table.

8.  Click **Done**. Confirm the changes by clicking **Okay.**

9.  Click **Save Table**.

### Task 2 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment form

In this task, you will perform the following changes to the form: 

- Put fields in the header 
- Insert the Timeline control
- Add a tab that contains a list of related assessment questions

To customize your form:

1.  Navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com>.

2.  Make sure you are in the **Practice** environment you created.

    click **edit** (the pencil icon).

10. In the **Field Explorer** (the left bar showing the fields), uncheck the **Show only unused fields** checkbox.
