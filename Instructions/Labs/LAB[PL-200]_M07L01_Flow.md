Module 7: Build Power Automate cloud flows
========================

## Lab 7.1: Practice Lab – Create a flow

### Important Notice (Effective November 2020):
Common Data Service has been renamed to Microsoft Dataverse. Some terminology in Microsoft Dataverse has been updated. For example, entity is now table and field is now column. 

While the application is in the process of updating its user experience, some references to terminology like the Common Data Service (now **Dataverse**), entity (now **table**), field (now **column**), and record (now **row**) may be out of date. Please keep this in mind as you work through the labs. We expect to have our content fully up to date very soon. 

For more information and for a complete list of affected terms, please visit [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro#terminology-updates)

Scenario
--------

As a functional consultant at Contoso, you are continuing to work on a
model-driven Knowledge Admin app for your client Fabrikam. Your client has
requested an automation that should run weekly without user involvement. You
can’t schedule a workflow without custom code so you will need to use a
Microsoft Power Automate cloud flow. In this lab, you will create a cloud flow
to run weekly and test the flow.

## Exercise 1 – Create Microsoft Power Automate cloud flow

In this exercise, you will create a cloud flow that will run once a week. This
flow will check if there are Knowledge Assessment with End Date of today or
older and deactivate them.
