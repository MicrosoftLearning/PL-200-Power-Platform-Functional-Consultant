# PL-200T00: Power Platform Functional Consultant Trainer Preparation Guide

## Required Materials to Teach This Course

To teach this course, you need the following materials:

- Microsoft PowerPoint files
- Microsoft Learn collection
- Student lab instructions

The Microsoft Learn modules are listed on the course page <https://aka.ms/MOC_PL-200T00>  (<https://docs.microsoft.com/training/courses/pl-200t00#StudyGuide>).

## Prerequisite Knowledge to Teach This Course

To successfully teach these courses, instructors must have experience leveraging the following:

- Microsoft Power Platform (including Power Apps, Power BI, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, and Microsoft Dataverse)
- Consulting skills (including requirements gathering and ALM)
- Project processes, methodologies, and best practices

## Preparation Tasks

Instructors should complete the following tasks to prepare for each of the courses in the Microsoft Power Platform (PL) series:

- Review all topics in the Microsoft Learn modules. You should be well-versed in every topic.
- Review all PowerPoint slides and make notes to match your specific teaching style. Add notes in the notes pane where necessary. Many of these concepts make for very robust and engaging demos. Where possible try to share the knowledge via a demo and not exclusively with PowerPoint slides.
- Be able to speak to each of the talking points or graphics on the slides. Be aware of the topic in Microsoft Learn that each slide aligns to.
- Several topics have discussion slides. The discussions are meant to engage students in both virtual and in-person training deliveries. Try to keep the students engaged in conversation.
- Not only should you review the labs, but you should be able to successfully complete them so that you become familiar with any of the difficult points. This will prepare you for helping students in class.

## Course Timing

This course is expected to take 4 full (8 hour) days, including labs (with breaks taken into consideration). We appreciate any feedback you can provide about timing considerations or scheduling changes that emerge during a live course.

### Labs

Labs are divided by module. The PowerPoint slides indicate when labs should be performed. You can find the labs that correspond to that module in the trainer PowerPoint slides in the GitHub repository.

## Lab Specification Guide

The PL-200 course provides a set of lab instructions hosted publicly on GitHub. These labs align with the content of certain modules within the course. In addition to the recommended schedule in this guide, you will find placeholder slides in the Instructor PowerPoint decks for each lab. Based on timing necessities or your own teaching preferences, you may choose to move these slides to different parts of the course and teach the labs at different points.

With a course that covers so many topics like this one it is not possible to have hands on opportunities for each topic. Whenever possible we have added links to other learning opportunities that might have hands on activities for students to try on their own. These links are not managed by the team that manages the course content, so please ensure the links are active prior to sharing with students.

### Lab Credentials

Almost all steps in the labs are performed in the Microsoft 365 tenants that learners acquire through the authorized lab hosting (ALH) provider. Since the labs are tenant-based and those tenants update each month, it is possible that some of the lab instructions become out of sync with the updated tenant. While we try to update the lab instructions regularly, be aware of this possibility.

Each student should be supplied with the following through the lab hosting provider:

- A blank virtual machine (if they choose to, they can forgo the virtual machine after acquiring the credentials and work in a browser on their local machine)
- A Microsoft 365 tenant credential, which they will use to acquire a Microsoft Power Platform trial.

Students should record these credentials upon their receipt and continue using the same credentials throughout the duration of the course.

### Lab Demos

To build a demo environment, you could complete the labs as a student would and use those as examples as needed for your demos. Demos are not required for each module. Do a few on topics that you feel most comfortable.

To build a demo environment, you could complete the labs as a student would and use those as examples as needed for your demos. Demos are not required for each module, but do add to the student experience and increases retention of learning. Do a few on topics that you feel most comfortable.

The course does not have student hands on for Power BI. If you have the chance to build and demonstrate these topics, that will certainly help students retain more of the details of the topics. We have included links for hands on opportunities for the students in the speaker notes for each of these modules.

### Lab Instructions

Student lab instructions are hosted on the public GitHub repository <https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/PL-200-Power-Platform-Functional-Consultant> for PL-200 in Markdown format.

Due to the dynamic nature of the products, we expect that the user experience of the technology will not always match the lab instructions perfectly. We encourage MCTs to contribute to the lab steps when a bug is noticed during course facilitation by creating a Pull Request.

Students can access the lab instructions using the more user-friendly GitHub pages feature <https://microsoftlearning.github.io/PL-200-Power-Platform-Functional-Consultant>. MCTs can distribute this link to students at their convenience. Please be aware that authorized lab hosters will often surface our lab instructions within their own user interface. These instructions are surfaced from a dynamic pull from our GitHub repositories, so they should always remain current with our GitHub site.

### Lab Timing

Labs are divided by module. Labs can either be completed either at the end of lessons within the modules, or at the end of the entire module. You can find the labs that correspond to that module in the trainer PowerPoint slides.

### Lab Issues

For issues where the user experience does not match the lab instructions (ie., buttons changed, placement of links changed, process changes), please raise the issue in the Issues section of the GitHub site. This will allow our content development team to make updates for the next course. For issues with the hosting platform or the tenant, please raise an issue directly with the support team of the Authorized Lab Hoster.
